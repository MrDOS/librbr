 *
 * \brief Instrument commands and structures pertaining to real-time data
 * acquisition.
 *
 * Note that the library provides no facility for parsing or receiving
 * streaming data from the instrument. The ability to configure instrument
 * streaming is provided only as a convenience for other consumers of the data.
 * If you will only be communicating with the instrument via this library, we
 * strongly suggest that you disable streaming data to avoid wasted bandwidth
 * and parsing overhead to ignore the streaming data emitted by the instrument.
