 * This function should block until data is available (even if only a single
 * byte) or until the timeout has elapsed, then return. It will be called
 * multiple times in quick succession if the library requires more data.
 *
 * The library will provide a destination for data read from the instrument via
 * the \a data argument. The maximum amount of data which can be written to
 * this location is given by the \a size argument. Before returning
 * #RBRINSTRUMENT_SUCCESS, the value of \a size should be updated by the
 * callback to reflect the number of bytes written to \a data. When a value
 * other than #RBRINSTRUMENT_SUCCESS is returned, any new value of \a size
 * is ignored, as is any data written to \a data.
 *
 * The function should return #RBRINSTRUMENT_SUCCESS when data is successfully
 * read from the instrument. In the event of any other value being returned,
 * the calling library function will treat that value as indicative of an
 * error, immediately perform any necessary cleanup, and then return that same
 * value to its caller. On Posix systems, the library will avoid doing anything
 * which might disturb the value of `errno` before returning to user code. It
 * is strongly suggested that #RBRINSTRUMENT_TIMEOUT be returned in the event
 * of a timeout and that #RBRINSTRUMENT_CALLBACK_ERROR be returned under any
 * other circumstance; that way a clear distinction can be made between errors
 * occurring in user code versus library code.

 * only occurs at the behest of the user, it is up to the user to define the
 * semantics of communication timeouts and to implement them. This could be a
 * constant read/write timeout, or a per-connection timeout tied to the
 * instrument by the user data pointer; the library is unopinionated.

 * If you pass pre-allocated memory, its contents will be discarded.
 *
 * The \a callbacks structure will be copied into the RBRInstrument structure;
 * no reference to it is retained, so any subsequent modifications will not
 * affect the connection. All callbacks must be given except for
 * RBRInstrumentCallbacks.sample. If any others are given as null pointers,
 * #RBRINSTRUMENT_MISSING_CALLBACK is returned and the instrument connection
 * will not be opened. RBRInstrumentCallbacks.sample is given, then
 * RBRInstrumentCallbacks.sampleBuffer must also be given; if it is not,
 * #RBRINSTRUMENT_MISSING_CALLBACK is returned.
 *
 * Whenever callbacks are called, the data passed to them should be handled
 * immediately. The pointers passed will coincide with buffers within the
 * RBRInstrument instance, and may be overwritten as soon as the callback
 * returns.
 *
 * This library supports 3rd-generation RBR instruments and, to a lesser
 * extent, 2nd-generation instruments. 1st-generation and third-party
 * instruments are not supported. If the library detects an unsupported
 * instrument during connection, #RBRINSTRUMENT_UNSUPPORTED is returned.
 *
 * In the event of any return value other than #RBRINSTRUMENT_SUCCESS, any
 * memory allocated by this constructor is freed. That is, in the event of
 * failure, no cleanup of library resources is required. In the event of a
 * successful result, RBRInstrument_close() should be used to terminate the
 * instrument connection.
