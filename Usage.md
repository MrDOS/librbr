# Usage

## Times

Function arguments represented as Unix timestamps
(seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z).
Values passed to and received from the instrument
will automatically be converted to and from
the instrument's string time format (“YYYYMMDDhhmmss”).

The clock and any other times
may be set to any time
between 2000-01-01 00:00:00
and 2099-12-31 23:59:59
inclusive.
