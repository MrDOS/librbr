1.0.3

The first line of this file indicates the library version number. This is used
automatically by the build process for both the library and the documentation.
No format restrictions or expectations are imposed by the library, but versions
released by RBR will follow [Semantic Versioning].

A leading “v” is omitted as it is not considered to be part of the version
number; it is part of the display formatting of the version number.

When incrementing the version number, remember to also:

* Update [the changelog].
* After committing the version bump, create an annotated Git tag
  (`git tag -a v0.0.0`) for the release.

[Semantic Versioning]: https://semver.org/
[the changelog]: CHANGES.md
