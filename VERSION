0.0.0

The first line of this file indicates the library version number. This is used
automatically by the build process for both the library and the documentation.
No format restrictions or expectations are imposed by the library, but versions
released by RBR will follow [Semantic Versioning].

A leading “v” is omitted as it is not considered to be part of the version
number; it is part of the display formatting of the version number.

[Semantic Versioning]: https://semver.org/
